# dgsred: DGS reduction interface for chopper spectrometers

This package contains interfaces for data reduction software 
for direct-geometry chopper spectrometers.

The software here makes heavy use of Mantid, with the goal of
providing easier-to-use interfaces.

Currently the interface is an xml file and it allows for
batch reduction, reduction of scans and sweeps.
